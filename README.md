An actively developed community branch of the first fully onchain ZK war game.

**Zero-knowledge exploration. Onchain strategy. Endless space.**

---

Dark Forest is a fully onchain ZK war game of exploration, strategy, and
conquest. The original project was developed by the Dark Forest official team
from 2019 to Q1 2022.

Dark Forest Ares is a community-maintained branch by the DFArchon team. The
original Ares line ran from Q1 2023 to Q2 2024, and the project is now active
again with a new 2026 test round.

## Launch a Local Universe

Use Node.js 16.

```sh
yarn
```

If dependency installation fails, try `npm install` once, then continue with
Yarn.

Run the local universe with Ganache. It is faster for daily development and
keeps blocks on disk between restarts.

```sh
yarn workspace eth ganache
yarn workspace eth hardhat:dev deploy
yarn workspace client start:dev
```

Open `http://localhost:8081`.

## Stack

`Solidity` / `Hardhat` / `TypeScript` / `React` / `WebGL` / `SNARKs`

Dark Forest Ares is organized as a full onchain game stack:

- `circuits/` defines the zero-knowledge circuits for hidden movement and
  exploration. Players produce proofs from these circuits; the contracts verify
  those proofs before accepting state changes onchain.
- `eth/` contains the Solidity universe, Hardhat deployment flow, tests, and
  admin tasks. It is the settlement layer for every valid proof-backed action.
- `packages/` contains shared TypeScript modules for constants, types, game
  logic, rendering, settings, hashing, and SNARK interfaces.
- `client/` contains the browser game client, UI, plugins, storage, networking,
  and WebGL renderer.

The result is a self-contained Dark Forest universe: contracts define the world,
shared packages keep game rules consistent, and the client turns hidden onchain
state into playable strategy.

## Ares Versions

Dark Forest Ares evolved across four community rounds, then returned to active
development with a new 2026 test round.

- `2023 May` / `v0.1.1` - introduced Fire Link, Ice Link, Stellar Shield, and
  Avatar; added artifact purchasing; added cooldowns for artifact purchases and
  activations.
- `2023 Nov` / `v0.1.2` - introduced the Pink Bomb; upgraded the ZK circuit so
  central planets can reach higher levels while hiding exact coordinates; ranked
  players higher for claiming planets closer to the universe center.
- `2024 May` / `v0.1.3` - introduced the Kardashev artifact for blue-zone
  resource mobilization; added purchases for planets, artifacts, and skins;
  introduced sponsor-backed bounties.
- `2024 Aug` / `v0.1.4` - introduced the Union system for cooperative energy
  support; added a dynamically shrinking inner radius to slow early center
  capture and keep the round competitive.
- `2026 Jun` / `v0.1.5` - brings Ares back as a modern test round with
  configurable artifact rules, buy-energy flow, quick-join settings, and
  smoother transaction UX.
